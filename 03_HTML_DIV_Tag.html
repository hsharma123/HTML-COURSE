    <p>aiden Test century against the West Indies in 2009 at Kingstown to help Bangladesh record their first overseas test win.
        He smashed 151 against India at Dhaka, but it was the England bowling that he relished the most. In six Test innings against them, he has five scores of over fifty. His memorable moment came on the tour to England, when he got his name on the honours board at Lord’s by becoming the first Bangladeshi player to score a century. He scored another ton at Old Trafford to cap off a wonderful summer. His performances in that tour led to Wisden naming him as the Cricketer of the year in 2011. He is currently the second Bangladeshi to play for an English county when he joined Nottinghamshire.

        The nephew of former Bangladesh skipper Akram Khan, Tamim has shown that he has the potential to achieve greatness.
        He was picked by Nottinghamshire as a short-term replacement for David Hussey as he was called up for the National duty. Tamim was not so successful with the bat and he scored just 104 runs with a highest score of 47.
        He was under immense pressure from the Bangladeshi media especially when he played against Worcestershire, who were fielding Shakib Al Hasan.

        Bangladesh toured Zimbabwe in July 2011 for a single Test and five ODIs. Zimbabwe were returning from a six-year exile from Tests, although Bangladesh had not played in the format for more than 14 months. Despite claiming in a press confidence that Zimbabwe's bowlers posed little threat, Tamim managed just 58 runs in the Test as Bangladesh slid to defeat. Bangladesh also lost the ODI series against Zimbabwe 3–2. All Bangladeshi batsme</p>
